      <h1> Welcome to Shayne's site!</h1>
            <h2>I was born in 2010 and was found on the streets of Jersey City, NJ in 2011.<br> In 2012, I found my forever home and ended up living the good life!</h2> 
      <h3 class="bio">Here is a timeline of how my life started:</h3>
      <p class="timeline">I was found by animal control officers as a stray and brought to the shelter.<br> I was cleaned up and then brought to a doggie daycare where my dad worked. <br> He adopted me almost as soon as he saw me (I mean, who wouldn't?)<br> I've had to train him a little, but he's doing alright now ;)</p>
